Here are some sample programs (C & C++) to
calculate PI.  

Note that these are not the fastest methods
to compute PI, these are here simply for
illustration.  These programs could be used 
as a starting template for a new program.

The fastest algorithm I came across for PI
is actually used the library (mapm_cpi.c)

I included a short build script for use 
under Linux and generic Unix using gcc.
It should be relatively easy to build these
demo programs using other O/S's / compilers.
